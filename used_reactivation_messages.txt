Sweet|You used to make my heart skip. Is it selfish to want that feeling again?
Needy|I need your chaos back in my inbox. Will you stir things up again?
Needy|I've been curling up in bed replaying our chats. Want to start a new one with me?
Dirty|I need you to ruin my mind before my body. Can you handle that?
Dirty|I miss your dominance in my inbox. Would you remind me who I belong to?
Dirty|I've been teasing myself thinking of your mouth. Want to finish what I started?
Dirty|I've been arching my back for no one but you. Would you press yourself into me now?
Dirty|I came thinking about the way you speak to me. Want to do it again, slower this time?
Dirty|I want to be your mess again. Can I be your dirty little secret tonight?
Dirty|The things I want to do to you would ruin us both. Want to hear the first one?
